# learning-notes

A lightweight learning knowledge base: **Markdown notes** + **Jupyter labs**.

## Structure
- `NOTES/` — curated notes (Markdown)
- `LABS/` — runnable experiments (Jupyter + src)
- `DATA/` — small sample data or links (no large datasets)
- `ASSETS/` — figures/images used in notes

## How to read
Start here: `NOTES/00_index.md`  
Progress tracker: `NOTES/00_roadmap.md`

## How to run labs
See: `LABS/README.md`

## Conventions
- Notes are written with a consistent template (TL;DR → Core → Pitfalls → Checklist → References)
- Notebooks are either:
  - `E_` exploratory (messy allowed)
  - `R_` reproducible (clean, rerunnable)
